# Compare embedding vectors versus sequence similarity effectiveness for distinguishing kinase and phosphatase protein families.
Calculate pairwise Percentage sequence similarity. When the percentage sequence identity between their two sequences is sufficiently high, it is believed that protein pairs have similar structures.
• Using embedding vectors as opposed to the traditional way of using sequence similarity to find how well the 2 protein families can be distinguished.
• Using sequence similarity and embedding vector we can find if the protein is similar to its family without going into the expensive procedures of systematic experimental structure determination.
